      <description>The final goal of this project is to control a group of three omnidirectional robots to move some heavy objects together. There are two parts to this robot. The top half part of this robot is a delta robot, which is used to withstand some heavy objects. The bottom half part of this robot is an omnidirectional mobile robot with four mecanum wheels.
I focus on the bottom part of the robot.</description>

      <description>In this robot simulation, a new object will be assembled by two UR5 arms with RG2 grippers. These two UR5 arms will be controlled by the Moveit!, remote API, python3, and ROS. The whole simulation will be done in the CoppeliaSim cross-platform. The docker approach will be helpful to make sure that everyone will run the code in the same environment with different machines and operating systems.
